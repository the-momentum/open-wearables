<Warning>
**Before you start:** The Strava integration is intended solely for the Open Wearables single-user usage scenario (i.e., personal use, not as an aggregator of multiple users’ data). Keep in mind:
- **No analytics** are calculated from Strava data — it is only aggregated and displayed as-is.
- **Only one athlete** (single user) can be connected to the integration at a time.
- This integration should be used as a **data tracker**, not as a data source for business analytics or reporting.
</Warning>

<Note>
**Need help with your Strava integration?** Pop into our [Discord](https://discord.gg/qrcfFnNE6H) if you have questions or want to discover how Open Wearables can solve your problems.
</Note>

## Overview

Strava provides access to activity/workout data through their API. The integration supports real-time webhook notifications for new activities as well as historical activity data via polling.

### Supported data types

| Data Type | Support |
|-----------|---------|
| Workouts / Activities | Yes |
| Sleep | No |
| Daily summaries (247 data) | No |
| Body composition | No |

Strava is an activity-focused platform — it does not provide continuous health monitoring data like sleep, HRV, or daily summaries.

### Data delivery

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Webhooks (push)** | Strava sends real-time notifications when activities are created or updated |
| **Polling (pull)** | Historical activity data can be fetched via the API |

## What you need by the end

- **App credentials**: Client ID + Client Secret
- **OAuth scopes** configured
- **Webhook verify token** set (a secret string you choose)
- **Webhook subscription** created (so Strava sends activity events to your server)

## Prerequisites

- A Strava account

## Application walkthrough

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Strava API Application">
    Log in to your Strava account and go to:

    - [https://www.strava.com/settings/api](https://www.strava.com/settings/api)

    Fill in the application form:
    - **Application Name**: Your app name
    - **Category**: Choose the category that best describes your app
    - **Website**: Your app's website URL
    - **Authorization Callback Domain**: `localhost` for local development, or your production domain (e.g. `yourdomain.com`)

    <Warning>
    The **Authorization Callback Domain** is just the domain, not the full URL. For local development, use `localhost`. Do not include the port or path.
    </Warning>

    After creating the app, you'll receive:
    - **Client ID**
    - **Client Secret**

    <Warning>
    Treat the Client Secret like a password. Store it in your secrets manager and rotate if compromised.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure credentials in Open Wearables">
    Add the following to your `.env` file:

```bash
#--- Strava ---#
STRAVA_CLIENT_ID=your-strava-client-id
STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET=your-strava-client-secret
STRAVA_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8000/api/v1/oauth/strava/callback
STRAVA_DEFAULT_SCOPE=activity:read_all,profile:read_all
STRAVA_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN=your-secret-verify-token
```

    **Configuration details:**

    | Variable | Description |
    |----------|-------------|
    | `STRAVA_CLIENT_ID` | Client ID from the Strava API settings page |
    | `STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET` | Client Secret from the Strava API settings page |
    | `STRAVA_REDIRECT_URI` | Must match the callback domain you set in Strava. For local dev: `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/oauth/strava/callback` |
    | `STRAVA_DEFAULT_SCOPE` | OAuth scopes requested during authorization. Default `activity:read_all,profile:read_all` covers all activity data and athlete profile |
    | `STRAVA_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN` | A secret string you choose. Strava will send this back during webhook subscription verification to confirm ownership. Pick something unique and hard to guess |

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a webhook subscription">
    To receive real-time activity notifications, you need to create a webhook subscription with the Strava API. Your server must be publicly accessible for Strava to reach the webhook endpoint.

    Create the subscription using the Strava API:

```bash
curl -X POST https://www.strava.com/api/v3/push_subscriptions \
  -F client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID \
  -F client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET \
  -F callback_url=https://yourdomain.com/api/v1/strava/webhook \
  -F verify_token=YOUR_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN
```

    When Strava receives this request, it will send a GET request to your `callback_url` with a `hub.verify_token` parameter. Open Wearables will validate the token against your `STRAVA_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN` and echo back the challenge to confirm the subscription.

    <Warning>
    The `callback_url` must be publicly accessible over HTTPS. For local development, use a tunneling tool like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose your local server.
    </Warning>

    <Note>
    Strava allows only **one webhook subscription per application**. If you need to change the callback URL, delete the existing subscription first:

```bash
# List existing subscriptions
curl -G https://www.strava.com/api/v3/push_subscriptions \
  -d client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID \
  -d client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET

# Delete a subscription
curl -X DELETE "https://www.strava.com/api/v3/push_subscriptions/SUBSCRIPTION_ID" \
  -d client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID \
  -d client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
```
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify the integration">
    Once everything is configured:

    1. Start your Open Wearables instance
    2. Connect a Strava account through the OAuth flow
    3. Create or record an activity on Strava
    4. The webhook should deliver the event and Open Wearables will fetch and store the full activity data

    You can check the webhook health endpoint at:
    ```
    GET /api/v1/strava/health
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## OAuth Scopes Reference

| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `activity:read` | Read public activities |
| `activity:read_all` | Read all activities (including private) |
| `profile:read_all` | Read athlete profile |

The default scope `activity:read_all,profile:read_all` is recommended for full activity data access.
