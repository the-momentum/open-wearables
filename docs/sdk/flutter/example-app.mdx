## Overview

The SDK repository includes a fully functional example app that demonstrates how to use SDK to sync Apple Health data with Open Wearables. It's also a great way for individuals to sync their personal health data and get it into Open Wearables in minutes! Use it to test the SDK, explore the code, and see how everything works together.

## What You'll See

The example app demonstrates the complete integration flow:

1. **SDK Configuration** - Initialize the SDK with proper environment settings
2. **Authentication** - Sign in with credentials from the dashboard
3. **Permission Request** - Request HealthKit permissions from the user
4. **Background Sync** - Enable automatic health data synchronization
5. **Sync Status** - Monitor sync progress and handle interruptions

## See it in action

See the full flow from setup to insights — how data flows from your device to Open Wearables and how you can use it.

### 1. Open Wearables Dashboard - Creating User Token

First, you need to create a user and generate an access token in the Open Wearables dashboard. This video shows:
- Login to the dashboard
- Creating a new user in the dashboard
- Generating an `invitation code` for SDK authentication

/>

### 2. Mobile App - Connecting and Syncing

After setting the invitation code and host URL from the dashboard, the mobile app connects to HealthKit and syncs data:

<video
  controls
  className="rounded-lg mx-auto"
  style={{ maxWidth: '300px' }}
  src="/images/sdk/app-ow.mp4"
/>

<Tip>
  - Make sure to enter the **API URL** (e.g. `https://api.openwearables.ai`), not the dashboard URL (e.g. `https://app.openwearables.ai`).
  - If you're running Open Wearables locally, you need to expose it publicly so the mobile app can communicate with it. See the [ngrok setup guide](/dev-guides/ngrok-setup) for instructions.
</Tip>

### 3. Browse data in the dashboard

Once your data is synced, you can explore it in the Open Wearables dashboard:

  src="/images/sdk/dashboard.mp4"
/>

### 4. Talk to data via MCP

Use the Open Wearables MCP server to chat with health data using AI:

  style={{ aspectRatio: '16/9' }}

  title="Talk to health data via MCP"
  frameBorder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowFullScreen
/>

### 5. Explore the API to Fetch More Data

Use the Open Wearables REST API to programmatically access synced health data. Check out the [API documentation](/api-reference) to learn how to query, filter, and export your data.

## Running the Example App

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the repository">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/the-momentum/open_wearables_health_sdk.git
    cd open_wearables_health_sdk/example
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install dependencies">
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="iOS Setup">
    Open `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode and:
    
    1. Select your development team in **Signing & Capabilities**
    2. Ensure **HealthKit** capability is enabled
    3. Update the bundle identifier if needed
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get credentials from Open Wearables Dashboard">
    1. Go to your Open Wearables dashboard
    2. Create a new user or select an existing one
    3. Generate an access token for the user
    4. Copy the `userId` and `accessToken`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the app">
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```
    
    <Note>
      Run on a **physical iOS device** - HealthKit doesn't work in the simulator.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect and sync">
    1. Enter the `userId` and `accessToken` from the dashboard
    2. Tap **Sign In**
    3. Grant HealthKit permissions when prompted
    4. Tap **Start Sync** to begin background synchronization
    5. Check the dashboard to see your health data appear!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example App Code Structure

The example app demonstrates best practices for SDK integration:

```
example/
├── lib/
│   └── main.dart          # Main app with SDK integration
├── ios/
│   └── Runner/
│       └── Info.plist     # HealthKit permissions & background modes
└── pubspec.yaml           # Dependencies
```

### Key Code Sections

**SDK Initialization:**

```dart
await HealthBgSync.configure(
  environment: HealthBgSyncEnvironment.production,
);
```

**Sign In:**

```dart
await HealthBgSync.signIn(
  userId: userIdController.text,
  accessToken: accessTokenController.text,
);
```

**Request Permissions:**

```dart
await HealthBgSync.requestAuthorization(
  types: [
    HealthDataType.steps,
    HealthDataType.heartRate,
    HealthDataType.sleep,
    HealthDataType.workout,
    // ... more types
  ],
);
```

**Start Background Sync:**

```dart
await HealthBgSync.startBackgroundSync();
```

## Testing the Full Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set up Open Wearables locally (optional)">
    If you want to test with a local instance:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/the-momentum/open-wearables.git
    cd open-wearables
    docker compose up -d
    ```
    
    Then configure the SDK with your local URL:
    
    ```dart
    await HealthBgSync.configure(
      customSyncUrl: 'http://localhost:8000/sdk/users/{user_id}/sync/apple/healthkit',
    );
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create test data in Apple Health">
    Add some health data to Apple Health on your device:
    - Open the Health app
    - Browse → Steps → Add Data
    - Add a few data points
  </Step>

  <Step title="Trigger sync and verify">
    1. In the example app, tap **Sync Now**
    2. Check the Open Wearables dashboard
    3. Your health data should appear under the user's timeseries!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting the Example App

  <Accordion title="No data syncing">
    - Confirm HealthKit permissions were granted (check iOS Settings → Privacy → Health)
    - Make sure there's actual health data in Apple Health
    - Try tapping **Sync Now** to trigger an immediate sync
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Xcode signing errors">
    - Select your development team in Xcode
    - Update the bundle identifier to something unique
