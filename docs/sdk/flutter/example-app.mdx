## Overview

The SDK repository includes a fully functional example app that demonstrates how to integrate health data synchronization with Open Wearables. Use it to test the SDK, explore the code, and see how everything works together.

## What You'll See

The example app demonstrates the complete integration flow:

1. **SDK Configuration** - Initialize the SDK with proper environment settings
2. **Authentication** - Sign in with credentials from the dashboard
3. **Permission Request** - Request HealthKit permissions from the user
4. **Background Sync** - Enable automatic health data synchronization
5. **Sync Status** - Monitor sync progress and handle interruptions

## Demo Videos

### 1. Open Wearables Dashboard - Creating User Token

First, you need to create a user and generate an access token in the Open Wearables dashboard. This video shows:
- Creating a new user in the dashboard
- Generating an `accessToken` for SDK authentication
- Copying credentials to use in the mobile app

### 2. Mobile App - Connecting and Syncing

After getting credentials from the dashboard, the mobile app connects to HealthKit and syncs data:

/>

## Running the Example App

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the repository">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/the-momentum/open_wearables_health_sdk.git
    cd open_wearables_health_sdk/example
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install dependencies">
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="iOS Setup">
    Open `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode and:
    
    1. Select your development team in **Signing & Capabilities**
    2. Ensure **HealthKit** capability is enabled
    3. Update the bundle identifier if needed
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get credentials from Open Wearables Dashboard">
    1. Go to your Open Wearables dashboard
    2. Create a new user or select an existing one
    3. Generate an access token for the user
    4. Copy the `userId` and `accessToken`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the app">
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```
    
    <Note>
      Run on a **physical iOS device** - HealthKit doesn't work in the simulator.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect and sync">
    1. Enter the `userId` and `accessToken` from the dashboard
    2. Tap **Sign In**
    3. Grant HealthKit permissions when prompted
    4. Tap **Start Sync** to begin background synchronization
    5. Check the dashboard to see your health data appear!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example App Code Structure

The example app demonstrates best practices for SDK integration:

```
example/
├── lib/
│   └── main.dart          # Main app with SDK integration
├── ios/
│   └── Runner/
│       └── Info.plist     # HealthKit permissions & background modes
└── pubspec.yaml           # Dependencies
```

### Key Code Sections

**SDK Initialization:**

```dart
await HealthBgSync.configure(
  environment: HealthBgSyncEnvironment.production,
);
```

**Sign In:**

```dart
await HealthBgSync.signIn(
  userId: userIdController.text,
  accessToken: accessTokenController.text,
);
```

**Request Permissions:**

```dart
await HealthBgSync.requestAuthorization(
  types: [
    HealthDataType.steps,
    HealthDataType.heartRate,
    HealthDataType.sleep,
    HealthDataType.workout,
    // ... more types
  ],
);
```

**Start Background Sync:**

```dart
await HealthBgSync.startBackgroundSync();
```

## Testing the Full Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set up Open Wearables locally (optional)">
    If you want to test with a local instance:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/the-momentum/open-wearables.git
    cd open-wearables
    docker compose up -d
    make init
    ```
    
    Then configure the SDK with your local URL:
    
    ```dart
    await HealthBgSync.configure(
      customSyncUrl: 'http://localhost:8000/sdk/users/{user_id}/sync/apple/healthkit',
    );
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create test data in Apple Health">
    Add some health data to Apple Health on your device:
    - Open the Health app
    - Browse → Steps → Add Data
    - Add a few data points
  </Step>

  <Step title="Trigger sync and verify">
    1. In the example app, tap **Sync Now**
    2. Check the Open Wearables dashboard
    3. Your health data should appear under the user's timeseries!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting the Example App

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="App crashes on launch">
    Make sure you're running on a **physical device**, not the simulator. HealthKit is not available in the iOS Simulator.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Sign-in fails">
    - Verify your `userId` and `accessToken` are correct
    - Check that your Open Wearables instance is running
    - Ensure network connectivity
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="No data syncing">
    - Confirm HealthKit permissions were granted (check iOS Settings → Privacy → Health)
    - Make sure there's actual health data in Apple Health
    - Try tapping **Sync Now** to trigger an immediate sync
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Xcode signing errors">
    - Select your development team in Xcode
    - Update the bundle identifier to something unique
    - Ensure your Apple Developer account has HealthKit capability
  </Accordion>
