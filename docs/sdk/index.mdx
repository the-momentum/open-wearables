## Introduction

Open Wearables Sync SDKs enable seamless background synchronization of health data directly from Apple HealthKit to the Open Wearables platform.

Unlike cloud-based providers (Garmin, Polar, Suunto) that use webhooks and OAuth, Apple HealthKit requires a **push-based model** where data is sent from the user's device to your backend.

<Note>
  **Why Push-Based?** Apple HealthKit doesn't expose a cloud API. Health data lives exclusively on the user's device, so the mobile app must actively push data to your backend.
</Note>

## Architecture Overview

<Steps>
  <Step title="Apple Health (HealthKit)" icon="heart-pulse">
    Health data is stored locally on the user's iOS device in Apple Health.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Your Flutter App + Sync SDK" icon="mobile">
    The SDK reads data from HealthKit and handles background synchronization automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Wearables Platform" icon="cloud-arrow-up">
    Data is pushed to `POST /sdk/users/{user_id}/sync/apple` and normalized to the unified data model.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Features

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Background Sync" icon="rotate">
    Health data syncs automatically even when your app is in the background, using iOS Background App Refresh.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Incremental Updates" icon="bolt">
    Uses anchored queries to sync only new data since the last sync, minimizing battery usage and network traffic.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Secure Storage" icon="shield">
    Credentials stored securely in iOS Keychain. API keys never leave your backend.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Wide Data Support" icon="chart-line">
    Steps, heart rate, workouts, sleep, body measurements, nutrition, and more - all normalized to Open Wearables data model.

## How It Differs from Cloud Providers

| Aspect | Cloud Providers (Garmin, Polar) | Apple HealthKit |
|--------|--------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Data Source** | Provider's cloud servers | User's device only |
| **Sync Model** | Pull/Webhook (server-to-server) | Push (device-to-server) |
| **OAuth** | Required for authorization | Not applicable |
| **Connectivity** | Works anytime | Requires device to be online |
| **Battery Impact** | None on device | Optimized background sync |
| **Data Freshness** | Provider-dependent | Real-time from device |

## Security Model

The SDK uses a secure token-based authentication flow that keeps your API keys safe:

1. **API Keys stay on your backend** - Never exposed to mobile apps
2. **Short-lived access tokens** - Generated server-to-server, used by mobile SDK
3. **Secure credential storage** - iOS Keychain
4. **Optional token refresh** - SDK can automatically refresh expired tokens

<Warning>
  **Never embed your Open Wearables API Key in your mobile app.** Always generate access tokens on your backend and pass only the token to the mobile SDK.
</Warning>
