## Overview

Whoop provides access to workout, sleep, recovery, and body measurement data through their REST API. The integration uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication and pull-based syncing to fetch data.

### Supported data types

| Data Type | Support |
|-----------|---------|
| Workouts / Activities | Yes |
| Sleep (with stages) | Yes |
| Recovery (score, resting HR, HRV, SpO2, skin temp) | Yes |
| Body measurements (height, weight) | Yes |
| Continuous heart rate / activity samples | No (not available via API) |

### Data delivery

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Polling (pull)** | Open Wearables periodically fetches workout, sleep, recovery, and body measurement data via the Whoop API (default: every hour via Celery Beat) |

<Info>
**Webhooks:** Whoop supports webhooks for `workout`, `sleep`, and `recovery` events (created, updated, deleted). Open Wearables does not yet implement a Whoop webhook handler — data is currently synced via periodic polling only. Webhook support is planned for a future release.
</Info>

## What you need by the end

- **App credentials**: Client ID + Client Secret
- **OAuth scopes** configured
- **Redirect URI** registered in the Whoop Developer Dashboard

## Prerequisites

- A Whoop account with an active membership

## Application walkthrough

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign up for Whoop">
    You must have a Whoop membership to develop on the Whoop Developer Platform. Your Whoop account is also your developer login.

    If you don't have one yet, [join Whoop here](https://www.whoop.com/).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Team in the Developer Dashboard">
    Go to the [Whoop Developer Dashboard](https://dash.whoop.com/) and sign in with your Whoop account credentials.

    Before creating an app, you'll be prompted to create a **Team**. Choose a name for your team and click **Create Team**.

    <Note>
    You can invite other developers to your team later from the Team section of the Developer Dashboard. They'll need a Whoop account to be added.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create an App">
    In the Developer Dashboard, go to the app creation flow:

    - **App Name**: Your application name
    - **Scopes**: Select the scopes your app needs (see table below)
    - **Redirect URIs**: Add your OAuth callback URL (e.g. `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/oauth/whoop/callback` for local development)

    After creating the app, you'll receive:
    - **Client ID**
    - **Client Secret**

    <Warning>
    Your Client Secret should never be logged or shared. It should only be used server-side and never exposed in client, web, or mobile applications.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure credentials in Open Wearables">
    Add the following to your `.env` file:

```bash
#--- Whoop ---#
WHOOP_CLIENT_ID=your-whoop-client-id
WHOOP_CLIENT_SECRET=your-whoop-client-secret
WHOOP_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8000/api/v1/oauth/whoop/callback
WHOOP_DEFAULT_SCOPE=offline read:cycles read:sleep read:recovery read:workout
```

    **Configuration details:**

    | Variable | Description |
    |----------|-------------|
    | `WHOOP_CLIENT_ID` | Client ID from the Whoop Developer Dashboard |
    | `WHOOP_CLIENT_SECRET` | Client Secret from the Whoop Developer Dashboard |
    | `WHOOP_REDIRECT_URI` | Must match a redirect URI registered in the Developer Dashboard. For local dev: `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/oauth/whoop/callback` |
    | `WHOOP_DEFAULT_SCOPE` | OAuth scopes requested during authorization. The `offline` scope is required for refresh tokens |

  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify the integration">
    Once everything is configured:

    1. Start your Open Wearables instance
    2. Connect a Whoop account through the OAuth flow
    3. Trigger a sync — Open Wearables will fetch workouts, sleep, recovery, and body measurement data
  </Step>

  <Step title="Submit your app for production (when ready)">
    While developing, your app works in development mode. When you're ready to launch:

    1. Go to the Developer Dashboard
    2. Submit your app for approval
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Rate Limits

Whoop applies two rate limits by default:

| Limit | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Per minute | 100 requests |
| Per day | 10,000 requests |

**How Open Wearables uses the quota:** Each sync cycle per user makes ~4-7 API requests (workouts, sleep, recovery, and body measurements — each paginated at 25 items per page). With the default polling interval of 1 hour, that's roughly **~120 requests per user per day**. This means the default rate limits comfortably support **~60-80 connected users** per app.

If you need to support more users right now, you can request increased rate limits from Whoop via the [Developer Dashboard](https://dash.whoop.com/).

<Info>
We're working on optimizing the sync strategy (webhook-based updates instead of periodic polling, smarter pagination) to significantly increase the number of supported users without requiring a rate limit increase from Whoop.

## OAuth Scopes Reference

| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `offline` | Required to receive refresh tokens for long-lived access |
| `read:cycles` | Read physiological cycle data |
| `read:sleep` | Read sleep data (sessions, stages, efficiency) |
| `read:recovery` | Read recovery data (score, resting HR, HRV, SpO2, skin temp) |
| `read:workout` | Read workout/activity data |
| `read:body_measurement` | Read body measurements (height, weight) |
| `read:profile` | Read user profile information |

The default scope `offline read:cycles read:sleep read:recovery read:workout` covers all data types currently processed by Open Wearables.
