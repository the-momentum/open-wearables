## Overview

Apple Health integration uses a **push-based model** where health data is sent from the user's device to Open Wearables using our mobile SDK. This is different from cloud providers like Garmin or Polar that use webhooks.

<Note>
  **Why Push-Based?** Apple HealthKit doesn't expose a cloud API. Health data lives exclusively on the user's device, so your mobile app must actively push data to your backend using our SDK.

## Flutter SDK Quick Start

The fastest way to integrate Apple Health:

```dart
import 'package:health_bg_sync/health_bg_sync.dart';

// 1. Configure SDK
await HealthBgSync.configure();

// 2. Sign in with credentials from your backend
await HealthBgSync.signIn(
  userId: credentials.userId,
  accessToken: credentials.accessToken,
);

// 3. Request permissions
await HealthBgSync.requestAuthorization(
  types: [
    HealthDataType.steps,
    HealthDataType.heartRate,
    HealthDataType.sleep,
  ],
);

// 4. Start background sync
await HealthBgSync.startBackgroundSync();
```
