## What It Does

Open Wearables provides a unified API and developer portal to connect and sync data from multiple wearable devices and fitness platforms. Instead of implementing separate integrations for Garmin, Fitbit, Oura, Whoop, Strava, and Apple Health, you can use a single platform to access normalized health data and build intelligent health insights through AI-powered automations.

**Vision**: Health Insights automations unlock the potential of user data and allow you to drive businesses in a completely new way. By defining conditions in natural language, developers can create intelligent notifications and insights that respond to user health patterns, enabling new types of health applications and services.

<Note>
  **For Individuals**: This platform can also be used by individuals who want to interact with their own wearable data. Connect your devices, use the AI Health Assistant to chat with your health data, and set up personal health insights automations - all while keeping your data on your own infrastructure.

## Why Use Open Wearables

**For Developers Building Health Apps:**
- 🔌 Integrate multiple wearable providers through one API instead of maintaining separate implementations
- 📊 Access normalized health data across different devices (heart rate, sleep, activity, steps, etc.)
- 🤖 Build AI-powered health insights and automations using natural language
- 🏠 Self-hosted solution - deploy on your own infrastructure with full data control
- 🚀 No third-party dependencies for core functionality - run it locally with `docker compose up`
- 🧩 Embeddable widgets for easy integration into your applications

**The Problem It Solves:**

Building a health app that supports multiple wearables typically requires:
- ⏱️ Weeks of development per provider integration
- 🔐 Managing different OAuth flows and APIs for each service
- 📦 Handling various data formats and units
- 🔧 Maintaining multiple SDKs and dealing with API changes

Open Wearables handles this complexity so you can focus on building your product.

## Use Cases

- 👤 **Personal Use**: Individuals can self-host the platform to connect their own wearables, chat with their health data using the AI Health Assistant, and set up personal health insights - all with complete data privacy and control
- 🏃 **Fitness Coaching Apps**: Connect user wearables to provide personalized training recommendations. Running coaches can create users, share connection links via WhatsApp, and test AI insights capabilities
- 🏥 **Healthcare Platforms**: Aggregate patient health data from various devices and set up automations for health alerts
- 💪 **Wellness Applications**: Track and analyze user activity across different wearables with AI-powered insights
- 🔬 **Research Projects**: Collect standardized health data from multiple sources
- 🧪 **Product Pilots**: Non-technical product owners can test platform functionality by sharing connection links with users without needing their own app
