## Configuration

Add the following to your Cursor MCP settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "open-wearables": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--frozen",
        "--directory",
        "/path/to/open-wearables/mcp",
        "start"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

<Warning>
  Replace `/path/to/open-wearables/mcp` with the actual path to the MCP directory on your system.
</Warning>

## Verifying the Connection

After configuring Cursor:

1. Restart Cursor
2. Open the AI chat panel
3. Try asking: "Who can I query health data for?"

If configured correctly, the AI will use the `get_users` tool to fetch available users from your Open Wearables instance.

## Testing with MCPJam

[MCPJam](https://www.mcpjam.com/) is a local inspector for testing MCP servers. It provides a UI to explore tools, test calls, and debug responses.

```bash
npx @mcpjam/inspector@latest
```

Then configure the connection:
- **Command**: `uv`
- **Arguments**: `run --frozen --directory /path/to/open-wearables/mcp start`

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid API key" error

Ensure your `OPEN_WEARABLES_API_KEY` in `config/.env` is valid. You can get an API key from:
1. The Open Wearables developer portal
2. Or via the backend admin panel at `/api/v1/developer/api-keys`

### "Connection refused" error

Make sure the backend is running at the URL specified in `OPEN_WEARABLES_API_URL`.

For local development:
```bash
# From project root
docker compose up -d
```

### No users found

The API key determines which users you can see. Ensure:
1. Users have been created via the API or SDK
2. Your API key has access to those users
