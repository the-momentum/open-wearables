## What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a standard for connecting AI assistants to external data sources. The Open Wearables MCP server enables AI tools like **Claude Desktop** and **Cursor** to query your wearable health data through natural language conversations.

<Note>
  The MCP server is **decoupled** from the backend - it communicates via REST API using your API key. This means it can be deployed independently and uses existing, tested API endpoints.
</Note>

## Available Tools

The MCP server provides the following tools for AI assistants:

    Discover users accessible via your API key. Optionally filter by name or email.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Activity Summary" icon="person-running">
    Get daily activity data including steps, calories, heart rate, and intensity minutes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Sleep Summary" icon="bed">
    Get sleep data for a user within a date range.

## Example Interactions

### Discovering users

```
User: "Who can I query health data for?"
Claude: [calls get_users()]
Claude: "I found 2 users: John Doe and Jane Smith."
```

### Querying sleep data

```
User: "How much sleep did John get last week?"
Claude: [calls get_users() to get John's user_id]
Claude: [calls get_sleep_summary(user_id="uuid-1", start_date="2026-01-28", end_date="2026-02-04")]
Claude: "John slept an average of 7 hours and 45 minutes over the last week.
His longest sleep was 8h 15m on Monday, and shortest was 6h 30m on Thursday."
```

### Generic request (no time range specified)

```
User: "Fetch workouts for John"
Claude: [calls get_users() to get John's user_id]
Claude: [defaults to last 2 weeks: calls get_workout_events(user_id="uuid-1", start_date="2026-01-21", end_date="2026-02-04")]
Claude: "Over the last 2 weeks, John completed 8 workouts..."
```

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager
- Running Open Wearables backend (or access to a deployed instance)
- Valid Open Wearables API key

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd mcp
uv sync --group code-quality
```

### 2. Configure environment

```bash
cp config/.env.example config/.env
```

Edit `config/.env` with your settings:

```bash
OPEN_WEARABLES_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
OPEN_WEARABLES_API_KEY=ow_your_api_key_here
```

### 3. Test the server

```bash
uv run start
```
