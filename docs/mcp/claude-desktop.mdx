Add the following to your Claude Desktop configuration file:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS">
    Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "open-wearables": {
          "command": "uv",
          "args": [
            "run",
            "--frozen",
            "--directory",
            "/path/to/open-wearables/mcp",
            "start"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    Edit `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`:

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "open-wearables": {
          "command": "uv",
          "args": [
            "run",
            "--frozen",
            "--directory",
            "C:\\path\\to\\open-wearables\\mcp",
            "start"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
  Replace `/path/to/open-wearables/mcp` with the actual path to the MCP directory on your system.
</Warning>

## Verifying the Connection

After configuring Claude Desktop:

1. Restart Claude Desktop
2. Look for the MCP tools icon in the chat interface
3. Try asking: "Who can I query health data for?"

If configured correctly, Claude will use the `get_users` tool to fetch available users from your Open Wearables instance.

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid API key" error

Ensure your `OPEN_WEARABLES_API_KEY` in `config/.env` is valid. You can get an API key from:
1. The Open Wearables developer portal
2. Or via the backend admin panel at `/api/v1/developer/api-keys`

### "Connection refused" error

Make sure the backend is running at the URL specified in `OPEN_WEARABLES_API_URL`.

For local development:
```bash
# From project root
docker compose up -d
```

### No users found

The API key determines which users you can see. Ensure:
1. Users have been created via the API or SDK
2. Your API key has access to those users
