Railway provides the fastest way to get a production Open Wearables instance running. The template deploys all required services with sensible defaults - no manual infrastructure setup needed.

<Tip>
An admin account is created automatically on first startup (`admin@admin.com` / `secret123`). To use custom credentials, set `ADMIN_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` on the **Backend** service before deploying (as shown on the video)
</Tip>

## What gets deployed

The Railway template provisions seven services:

| Service | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **PostgreSQL** | Primary database for users, health data, and API keys |
| **Backend** | FastAPI application server |
| **Frontend** | React dashboard |
| **Redis** | Broker for Celery task queue and caching |
| **Celery Worker** | Processes background tasks (data syncs, webhooks) |
| **Celery Beat** | Schedules recurring sync jobs |
| **Flower** | Celery monitoring dashboard |

All inter-service networking and environment variables are configured automatically by the template.

## Post-deploy setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure provider OAuth credentials">
    To enable wearable data syncing, add OAuth credentials for each provider you want to support on the **Backend** service.

    <Tip>
    You only need to configure providers you plan to use. See [Supported Providers](/providers/supported) for setup instructions for each one.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up a custom domain (optional)">
    Railway assigns a default `*.up.railway.app` domain to each service. To use your own domain:

    1. Open your **Frontend** service in Railway
    2. Go to **Settings > Networking > Custom Domain**
    3. Add your domain and configure the DNS records as shown

    Repeat for the **Backend** service if you want a custom API domain. Then update the following environment variables:

    | Variable | Service | Value |
    |----------|---------|-------|
    | `VITE_API_URL` | Frontend | Your backend URL (e.g. `https://api.yourdomain.com`) |
    | `CORS_ORIGINS` | Backend | Your frontend URL (e.g. `https://yourdomain.com`) |
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Environment variables reference

Key variables you may want to customize on the **Backend** service:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `SECRET_KEY` | JWT signing key | Auto-generated by template |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | Allowed CORS origins (comma-separated) | Frontend Railway URL |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Application log level | `info` |

<Note>
Database and Redis connection strings are injected automatically by Railway — you do not need to set these manually.
